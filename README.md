## Description

Hello! We are Tom & Daniel, welcome to our project. This project is a web application that allows a user to store a number of recipes in a Database and a list of recipes in another database. 

The idea is that the user updates the list of ingredients they have available every time they go food shopping, keeping an up-to-date inventory of what they have available in their kitchen. Our app will then search through the database of recipes and come up with suggestions based on what they have available. 

Another function of our app is the calories slider. Our users can select the maximum number of calories that they want their recipe to be and the app will only return recipes below this number.
