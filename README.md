  Full Stack - Front End
</h1>

## Task

- Plan your front end. What functionality do you want? How do you want it to interact with the API? What's important in terms of making sure that the user has a good experience?
- Break your plan into issues on your team's Trello board.
- Use a collaborative design tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create [wireframes](https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-wireframing/).
- Code your front end in this repository.

Note: When hooking up your back and front ends, remember to take [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) into account. Use the tools we learned such as CORS middleware and headers to facilitate this.
